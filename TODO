For auth override the following are required:

1. tcp port forwarding of port X to artifactory host:port.
2. Stream sniffing, we need to read the byte from the stream stripping out any Authorization headers.
3. Add the authorization header where it's:  ssh_user:encrypted password.
4. encrypted password comes from encrypting a salt and the username.
  Another option is to just pass a token, and then have an artifactory plugin verify the token
  by connecting back to the ssh server, but that adds an extra RT.
5. if in the same jvm 4 may change to be more secure.
6. write a plugin to validate the password.
